# [Pixate Documentation](http://pixate.com/docs)

This houses documentation and instructions for the Pixate Framework. Pages are rendered as part of our static website's build process. We use [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) for templating and [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) for a majority of our content via Jade filters.

All submissions are welcome. To submit a change, fork this repo, commit your changes, and send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
