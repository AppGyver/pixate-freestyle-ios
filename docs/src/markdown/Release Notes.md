**2.0RC1**

The 1.1 release has been changed to 2.0 as a result of breaking changes that have been introduced. The 2.0RC1 release effectively replaces what would have been the 1.1 beta 5 release. Starting with this release, the framework has been renamed from 'PXEngine' to 'Pixate'. Importing 'PXEngine.h' has been deprecated, but will continue to work for this release.

**1.1b4**

* Previously, it was recommended that you place your license registration call in main.m, and assign a class or id to the main window in your app delegate.

* The call to set the window styleMode needs to take place before **self.window makeKeyAndVisible]** (or **return YES** if you are using storyboards). Setting the window styleMode allows Pixate to style the main window and its children if no class/id is set on the children
* If you were previously assigning a class or id to the main window in your app delegate, this can be removed
